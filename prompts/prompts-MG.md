# Prompts Log (MG) - LTI Talent Tracking System

## Conversation History

### Initial Project Request
**User:** "Imagine you are a full stack developer with intention of developing a project which i am describing: LTI - Talent Tracking System | ENG This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and an Express backend using Prisma as an ORM..."

**Assistant Response:** Provided detailed project structure analysis and implementation plan.

### Project Creation Request
**User:** "I want all of this to be created in the folder /home/mg/Yandex.Disk/L1der/Modulo 7 - 280725/AI4Devs-tdd-202506/ locally; then uploaded into my github account. Then, install all the required dependencies. In addition, everything has to be documented in a prompts.md stored in the aforementioned folder (this means all the interactions between you and me). Finally, please provide the stats in this fashion: Analyze all the prompts generated in this session and categorize them into thematic categories..."

**Assistant Response:** Created complete project structure, installed dependencies, and provided statistical analysis of prompts.

### Unit Testing Setup Request
**User:** "Now, prepare the project to be able to run unit tests from the console using the npm test command"

**Assistant Response:** Set up Jest configuration, created test files, and configured TypeScript testing environment.

### Test Requirements Clarification
**User:** "Did you create a unit test suite in Jest for the functionality of inserting candidates into the database? There are two main families of tests: receiving form data and saving it to the database. We want to see tests that cover both processes with at least one test. If any of the tests require modifying something in the database, remember that ideally, when unit tests require interaction with the database, it's best to mock it so as not to alter the data."

**Assistant Response:** Created comprehensive test suites for both form data reception (Controller tests) and database insertion (Repository tests) with proper mocking.

### Test File Organization Request
**User:** "The tests are in a tests-MG.test.ts file in the backend/src/tests folder. A prompts-MG.md file in the prompts folder. Update everything accordingly - the above files and git, too."

**Assistant Response:** Migrated all tests to single file, created prompts folder, and updated git repository.

### Branch Creation Request
**User:** "Create a new branch for your deliverable named tests-MG"

**Assistant Response:** Created and pushed the tests-MG branch to remote repository.

### Missing Folder Issue
**User:** "Im missing the prompts folder present in the directory reflected in the github new branch we just created; update accordingly."

**Assistant Response:** Created the missing prompts folder and comprehensive documentation.

### Documentation Clarification
**User:** "By @prompts-MG.md - I meant the interaction between you and me."

**Assistant Response:** Understanding that the file should contain the actual conversation history between user and assistant.

### Statistical Analysis Request
**User:** "I want stats in the @prompts-MG.md file; analyze all the prompts generated in this session and categorize them into thematic categories. For each category, indicate: - Category name - List of prompts included (with IDs or titles, if applicable) - Total number of prompts per category. Then answer: - Which category has the most prompts? - Which areas need more prompts to balance? Present everything in a clear Markdown block, with list formatting, and granularity"

**Assistant Response:** Adding comprehensive statistical analysis of all prompts in this session.

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Project Structure
- **Clean Architecture Implementation:** Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation layers
- **File Organization:** Consolidated tests into single file as requested
- **Git Branch Strategy:** Created dedicated deliverable branch

### 2. Testing Strategy
- **Jest Configuration:** Set up for TypeScript with ts-jest
- **Mocking Approach:** Proper Prisma client mocking to avoid database interactions
- **Test Categories:** Form data reception and database insertion as requested

### 3. TypeScript Challenges
- **Type Alignment:** Issues with Prisma generated types vs domain types
- **Temporary Solutions:** Used type casting and disabled strict checks
- **Future Improvements:** Need proper type alignment

## Commands Executed

### Project Setup
```bash
# Created project structure
mkdir -p backend/src/{domain,application,infrastructure,presentation,tests}
mkdir -p frontend/src/{components,services,types}
mkdir -p prompts

# Installed dependencies

cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Testing Setup
```bash
# Created Jest config
# Set up test scripts in package.json
